title: About me
---

My research combines geological fieldwork, geochemistry, and Earth system modelling to investigate global biogeochemical cycles â€“ particularly the cycling of carbon between the atmosphere, the ocean, the biosphere, sediments, and the solid earth. I have worked across the geological timescale (Neoproterozoic to Holocene) with an emphasis on episodes of large igneous province emplacement, mass extinction, rapid climate change, and carbon cycle perturbations in the Meso-Cenozoic.
